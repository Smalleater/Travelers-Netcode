# Travelers-Netcode

---

## Overview

**TRA (Travelers Netcode)** is a cross-platform C++ netcode designed to simplify multiplayer game development.
It supports both Windows (via Winsock) and POSIX-compliant systems (via BSD sockets).

The current goal is to provide an optimized, lightweight, and easy-to-use netcode capable of handling all basic networking operations such as creating servers, connecting clients, sending packets, and more.
The ultimate goal is to develop TRA into a fully featured netcode specifically tailored for multiplayer needs.

## 🚧 Current Development Status

I am currently adding a basic server-side tick system as well as snapshots to begin implementing interpolation.

## 📘 Learning Purpose

This project is part of a personal journey to learn and improve my skills in **C++**, **network programming**, and **engine architecture**.
Both the netcode and the ECS library are developed with learning, experimentation, and long-term improvement in mind.

New features and improvements will continue to come as I explore and grow.
